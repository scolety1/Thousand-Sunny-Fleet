# Codex Fleet

Reusable local harness for running bounded Codex task loops across multiple projects.

## Projects

Configured in `projects.json`:

- EasyLife
- RestaurantDemo

## Commands

```powershell
cd C:\Dev\codex-fleet

.\fleet-status.ps1
.\fleet-brief.ps1
.\fleet-morning-review.ps1
.\make-context-bundles.ps1
.\run-fleet.ps1
```

`run-fleet.ps1` starts each project loop in a separate PowerShell window. Keep rounds low until the reports feel boring and predictable.

`make-context-bundles.ps1` writes paste-ready ChatGPT Pro context bundles into `out/`.

`fleet-morning-review.ps1` checks each configured project before you merge: branch, dirty state, unchecked tasks, changed files, recent report entries, and build result.

## Reusable Harness

Install the base docs/scripts into a new repo:

```powershell
.\install-harness.ps1 -Repo C:\Dev\your-project -Profile frontend-static-demo -AddToFleet
```

Generate a next-task request after a run:

```powershell
.\planner\prepare-next-task-request.ps1 -Repo C:\Dev\your-project
```

Ask Codex CLI to propose next tasks:

```powershell
.\planner\run-planner.ps1 -Repo C:\Dev\your-project
```

Validate and import proposed tasks:

```powershell
.\planner\import-next-tasks.ps1 -Repo C:\Dev\your-project -Mode append
```
